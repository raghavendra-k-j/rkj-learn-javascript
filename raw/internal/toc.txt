Recommended Learning Path for Maximum Impact
To stand out from millions of developers, you don't need to master every tool or runtime â€” but you should deeply understand:

JavaScript engine architecture (focus on V8)

How your code is parsed, compiled, and optimized

The differences between runtimes (browser, Node.js)

The event loop and concurrency model

Memory management and performance implications
